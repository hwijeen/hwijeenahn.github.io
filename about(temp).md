Hi, I'm hwijeen. Here is a little bit about myself!


## Education

* 2011 - 2018 : B.A. in American Culture and Psychology, Sogang University *(Summa Cum Laude)*
* 2018 - In progress : Natural Language Processing Lab in Computer Science and Engineering Department, Sogang University

The seemingly irrelevant majors reflect my broad academic interest. Although it's true that I've always tried to explore diverse fields, I've had one particular topic anchored in my mind : **language**. Programs in American Culture introduced the use and power of language to me. In particular, I was fascinated by Foucault's idea that knowledge(which includes language) is the very basis of power. Then, I was able to come across a scientific and quantitative approach to language through Psychology, which is my double major. I felt that I wanted to be more engaged in the world than broadening my knowledge. So, I ended up in Natural Language Processing Lab in Computer Science and Engineering department, where I could develop technology that would make tangible differences to people's daily lives. My aspiration is to build a machine translator that would lower the language barrier.


## Languages

* Korean : Native
* English : Fluent
* French : Intermediate
* C : Friendly
* C++ : Will learn some day
* Python : I like it

I feel that language is much more than just a tool for communication. If you learn a language, it's like to have access granted to a vast amount of information. The more language you are comfortable with, the more potential you are to imporve. I won't stop learning languages!

## Building Expertise In

* Natural Language Processing
* Mathematics Behind NLP
* Statistical Learning

My undergraduate years helped me gain comprehensive knowledge and understanding about language. As a graduate student, I'm motivated to focus on a specific perspective on language in order to become an expert.
