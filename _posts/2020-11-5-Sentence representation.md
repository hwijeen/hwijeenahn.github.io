## Motivation

A number of works deal with mining sentences from a large corpus (e.g. Common Crawl). For example, **Self-training Improves Pre-training for Natural Language Understanding** aims to retrieve in-domain unlabeled data and **Cross-lingual Retrieval for Iterative Self-Supervised Training** mines parallel data. This blog posts lists a number of off-the-shelf sentence embedding methods.
